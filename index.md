# Overview

This module examines how tools from AI can help judges make decisions.  Judges make decisions at several junctures of 
the justice system, pre- and post-trial. Their decisions concern matters of fact as well as matters of law. 
We will focus on decisions about matters of fact and examine three topics:

  1. Machine learning tools for risk assessment applied to decisions about bail, preventive detention and sentencing;

  2. Multiagent systems for deciding about the relevance and admissibility of evidence; and

  3. Argumentation structures and Bayesian networks for representing complex bodies of evidence.

Transversal to these topics, the module will also examine the different ways in which the judiciary 
can rely on findings about matters of fact that are entirely or partially based on automated elements, 
as well as the current legislative policies and case-law on the topic.
